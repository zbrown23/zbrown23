### Hi!

I'm Zach Brown, an Electrical Engineering Student at Case Western Reserve University. I was most recently employed as an Electrical Engineering intern at [Formlabs](https://formlabs.com), where I helped design, build, and write software for really cool 3D printers with really cool people.

Most of my work and experience lies in architecting systems, algorithms design and implementation, and controls. I build anything and everything, from [rocket engines](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRwU7fVsK0E) to [racecars](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbYI9bH2k-ggW2idGL_oSUA).

The languages I'm most comfortable in are C, C++, Python, and Matlab. I'm also familiar with Java, Kotlin, HDLs like SystemVerilog and VHDL, low level programming in Assembly, and even good ol' Minecraft redstone. 

I design a lot of PCBs, but most of them are done in Altium so I can't show them off here. I've done high speed, high voltage, and high density designs as well as "boring" 2-layer boards just to play around with.
