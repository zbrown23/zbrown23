### Hi!

I'm Zach Brown, a Starship Avionics Engineer at SpaceX.

Before that, I interned at [Formlabs](https://formlabs.com), where I built electrical systems and firmware for next-gen SLA and SLS 3D printers, as well as [Asensus Surgical](https://asensus.com/), where I developed power systems and instrumentation for surgical robots.

I am a full-stack EE, and do everything from PCB layout and embedded software to controls algorithms and network architecture. Some of my favorite projects include building [rocket engines](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRwU7fVsK0E) and [racecars](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbYI9bH2k-ggW2idGL_oSUA).

Most of my work is private or proprietary, but I share what I can here.
