### Hi!

I'm Zach Brown, an Electrical Engineering Student at Case Western Reserve University. I'm currently a Print Process Engineering Intern at [Formlabs](https://formlabs.com), where I help build really cool 3D printers with really cool people.

I'm not a "real" programmer per se, as most of my work focuses on architecture design, algorithms design and implementation, and control theory. I build anything and everything, from [rocket engines](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRwU7fVsK0E) to [racecars](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbYI9bH2k-ggW2idGL_oSUA).

The languages I'm most comfortable in are C/C++, Python, Java, Kotlin, and Matlab. I'm also familiar with HDLs like SystemVerilog, low level programming in Assembly, and even good ol' Minecraft redstone. 

I design a lot of PCBs, but unfortunately most of them are done in Altium. I've done high speed, high voltage, and high density designs as well as boring old 2-layer boards just to play around with.
